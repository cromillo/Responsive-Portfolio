          <p>Hello! I'm Claire. I was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States when I was nine years old. I now live in 
          Northridge, CA with my fiance and our three cats: Kita, Digi, and Kaia. For fun, I enjoy watching sports, running obstacle course 
          races, and working out at my Crossfit box. I graduated from California State University, Los Angeles with a Bachelors of Science degree 
          in Psychology, and from Mount Saint Mary's University, Los Angeles with my Master of Arts degree in Counseling Psychology.</p>
        
          <p>My professional background includes several years working in the non-profit sector serving marginalized communities, such as the 
            LGBTQ, HIV+, and homeless populations. I have worked as a case manager, group facilitator, programming coordinator, and a substance 
            abuse counselor. Some of my duties were assisting clients with gaining independence through life skills (financial management, employment, 
            education, accessing social services, legal issues, housing, healthcare, personal hygiene and coping); develop, implement and document an individualized 
            case management service plan with the client to address the needs identified in the initial DHS-approved psychosocial assessment; and Coordinate across 
            departments, agencies, partners and providers to resolve issues related to health and housing that jeopardize stability </p>

          <p>Recently, I have decided to pursue to learn a new skill, CODING! I am currently attending UCLA Extention's Full Stack Web Development 
            Bootcamp. Wish me luck as I go on this new adventure.</p>
